# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 19.1.1 with TypeScript 5.8.2
- Single-page application with component-based architecture
- State management using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef)
- Immutable state updates via Immer for complex nested state objects
- Context API for global state (Language, Appearance/Theme)

**Routing**: Page-based navigation without traditional routing library
- Managed via `currentPage` state in App.tsx
- PageKey type union controls available pages
- Scroll-to-top on page transitions

**UI/UX Patterns**:
- Dark/Light theme support with multiple color scheme presets
- RTL (Right-to-Left) support for Farsi language
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom modal system for AI Guide, Settings, Quota Errors, Login, Booking, Donations
- Toast notification system for user feedback
- Dropzone integration for file uploads
- Camera input support for mobile evidence/document capture

**State Management Strategy**:
- Main application state (`AppState` interface) centralized in App.tsx
- Checkpoint system for saving/restoring application state
- LocalStorage for persistence of checkpoints, theme preferences, CV drafts
- Auto-save mechanism with debouncing (5-second delay)

## Backend Architecture

**AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (via @google/genai package)
- Primary AI service for all natural language processing tasks
- Grounding search enabled for fact-checking and source attribution
- Thinking mode option for complex reasoning tasks
- Image generation via Imagen 3
- Vision capabilities for document/image analysis (OCR)

**Service Layer** (`services/` directory):
- `geminiService.ts`: Core AI operations wrapper
  - Document drafting and analysis
  - Legal research and citation finding
  - Strategy planning and task generation
  - Resume analysis and improvement
  - Social media content generation
  - Job search suggestions
  - Fraud detection and risk assessment
- `dbService.ts`: Data persistence layer
- `supabaseClient.ts`: Authentication and database client
- `cacheService.ts`: FastCache implementation for performance optimization

**API Communication**:
- Environment variable-based API key management (`GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- Error handling with user-friendly quota exhaustion detection
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Markdown parsing for structured AI responses

## Data Storage Solutions

**Primary Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- User authentication and session management
- Case data storage (legal cases, applications)
- Checkpoint persistence (planned)
- User profiles and preferences

**Local Storage**:
- Application checkpoints (serialized AppState)
- Theme and appearance preferences
- Language selection
- CV draft auto-save
- Fast cache entries

**In-Memory State**:
- Current session data (AppState)
- Chat histories
- AI-generated content before persistence
- Form inputs and temporary data

**File Handling**:
- Base64 encoding for file uploads to AI
- Support for DOCX, PDF, images (JPEG, PNG, WEBP)
- Mammoth.js for DOCX text extraction
- Camera capture with MediaStream API

## Authentication and Authorization

**Authentication Provider**: Supabase Auth
- Email/password authentication
- Session management with JWT tokens
- LoginModal component for user sign-in/sign-up
- User state stored in App.tsx (`currentUser`)

**Authorization Model**:
- Role-based access (regular users, admin dashboard)
- Admin dashboard separate from user dashboard
- Protected routes via conditional rendering based on `currentUser`

**Security Considerations**:
- API keys stored in environment variables
- Client-side validation for email format
- Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) for database access control
- No sensitive data in localStorage (only user preferences)
